![Golang First Class Functions](https://golangbot.com/content/images/2018/03/first-class-functions-golang.png)

Welcome to tutorial no. 34 in [Golang tutorial series](https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/).

### What are first class functions?

**A language that supports first class functions allows functions to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions and returned from other functions. Go has support for first class functions.**

In this tutorial, we will discuss the syntax and various use cases of first class functions.

### Anonymous functions

Let's start with a simple example which assigns a [function](https://golangbot.com/functions/) to a [variable](https://golangbot.com/variables/).

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func main() {  
    a := func() {
        fmt.Println("hello world first class function")
    }
    a()
    fmt.Printf("%T", a)
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/Xm_ihamhlEv)

In the program above, we have assigned a function to the variable `a` in line no. 8. This is the syntax for assigning a function to a variable. If you notice carefully, the function assigned to `a` does not have a name. **These kinds of functions are called anonymous functions since they do not have a name.**

The only way to call this function is using the variable `a`. We have done this in the next line. `a()` calls the function and this prints `hello world first class function`. In line no. 12 we print variable `a`'s type . This will print `func()`.

Running this program will print

```
hello world first class function  
func()  
```

It is also possible to call an anonymous function without assigning it to a variable. Let's see how this is done in the following example.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func main() {  
    func() {
        fmt.Println("hello world first class function")
    }()
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/c0AjB3g8UEn)

In the program above, an anonymous function is defined in line no. 8 and immediately after the function definition, we call the function using `()` in line no. 10. This program will output,

```
hello world first class function  
```

It is also possible to pass arguments to anonymous functions just like any other function.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func main() {  
    func(n string) {
        fmt.Println("Welcome", n)
    }("Gophers")
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/9ttJ5Wi4fj4)

In the program above, a string argument is passed to the anonymous function in line no. 10. Running this program will print,

```
Welcome Gophers  
```

### User defined function types

Just like we define our own [struct](https://golangbot.com/structs/#declaringastructure) types, it is possible to define our own function types.

```
type add func(a int, b int) int  
```

The code snippet above creates a new function type `add` which accepts two integer arguments and returns a integer. Now we can define variables of type `add`.

Let's write a program that defines a variable of type `add`.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

type add func(a int, b int) int

func main() {  
    var a add = func(a int, b int) int {
        return a + b
    }
    s := a(5, 6)
    fmt.Println("Sum", s)
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/n3yPQ7hG7ip)

In the program above, in line no.10, we define a variable `a` of type `add` and assign to it a function whose signature matches the type `add`. We call the function in line no. 13 and assign the result to `s`. This program will print,

```
Sum 11  
```

### Higher-order functions

The definition of Higher-order function from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) is **a function which does at least one of the following**

-   **takes one or more functions as arguments**
-   **returns a function as its result**

Let's look at some simple examples for the above two scenarios.

#### Passing functions as arguments to other functions

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func simple(a func(a, b int) int) {  
    fmt.Println(a(60, 7))
}

func main() {  
    f := func(a, b int) int {
        return a + b
    }
    simple(f)
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/C0MNwz2TSGU)

In the above example, in line no. 7 we define a function `simple` which takes a _function that accepts two int arguments and returns a int_ as a parameter. Inside the main function in line no. 12 we create an anonymous function `f` whose signature matches the parameter of the function `simple`. We call `simple` and pass `f` as an argument to it in the next line. This program prints `67` as output.

#### Returning functions from other functions

Now let's rewrite the program above and return a function from the `simple` function.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func simple() func(a, b int) int {  
    f := func(a, b int) int {
        return a + b
    }
    return f
}

func main() {  
    s := simple()
    fmt.Println(s(60, 7))
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/82y2caejUy8)

In the program above, the simple function in line no 7 returns a function that takes two `int` arguments and returns a `int` argument.

This simple function is called from line no. 15. The return value from simple is assigned to `s`. Now `s` contains the function returned by `simple` function. We call `s` and pass it two int arguments in line no. 16. This program outputs `67`.

### Closures

Closures are a special case of anonymous functions. Closures are anonymous functions that access the variables defined outside the body of the function.

An example will make things more clear.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func main() {  
    a := 5
    func() {
        fmt.Println("a =", a)
    }()
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/6QriMs-zbnf)

In the program above, the anonymous function accesses the variable `a` which is present outside its body in line no. 10. Hence this anonymous function is a closure.

Every closure is bound to its own surrounding variable. Let's understand what this means by using a simple example.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func appendStr() func(string) string {  
    t := "Hello"
    c := func(b string) string {
        t = t + " " + b
        return t
    }
    return c
}

func main() {  
    a := appendStr()
    b := appendStr()
    fmt.Println(a("World"))
    fmt.Println(b("Everyone"))

    fmt.Println(a("Gopher"))
    fmt.Println(b("!"))
}
```

[Run in background](https://play.golang.org/p/134NiQGPOcS)

In the program above, the function `appendStr` returns a closure. This closure is bound to the variable `t`. Let's understand what this means.

The variables `a` and `b` declared in line nos. 17, 18 are closures and they are bound to their own value of `t`.

We first call `a` with the parameter `World`. Now the value of `a`'s version of `t` becomes `Hello World`.

In line no. 20 we call `b` with the parameter `Everyone`. Since `b` is bound to its own variable `t`, `b`'s version of `t` has a initial value of `Hello` again. Hence after this function call, the value of `b`'s version of t becomes `Hello Everyone`. The rest of the program is self-explanatory.

This program will print,

```
Hello World  
Hello Everyone  
Hello World Gopher  
Hello Everyone !  
```

### Practical use of first class functions

Till now we have defined what first class functions are and we have seen a few contrived examples to learn how they work. Now let's write a concrete program that shows the practical use of first class functions.

We will create a program that filters a [slice](https://golangbot.com/arrays-and-slices/) of students based on some criteria. Let's approach this step by step.

First lets define the student type.

```
type student struct {  
    firstName string
    lastName string
    grade string
    country string
}
```

The next step is to write the `filter` function. This function takes a slice of students and a function that determines whether a student matches the filtration criteria as parameters. We will understand better once we write this function. Let's go ahead and do it.

```
func filter(s []student, f func(student) bool) []student {  
    var r []student
    for _, v := range s {
        if f(v) == true {
            r = append(r, v)
        }
    }
    return r
}
```

In the above function, the second parameter to `filter` is a function which takes a `student` as a parameter and returns a `bool`. This function determines whether a particular student matches a criteria or not. We iterate through the student slice in line no. 3 and and we pass each student as a parameter to the function `f`. If this returns `true`, it means that that the student has passed the filter criteria and he is added to the slice `r`. You might be a little confused about the real use of this function, but it will be clear once we complete the program. I have added the main function and have provided the full program below.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

type student struct {  
    firstName string
    lastName  string
    grade     string
    country   string
}

func filter(s []student, f func(student) bool) []student {  
    var r []student
    for _, v := range s {
        if f(v) == true {
            r = append(r, v)
        }
    }
    return r
}

func main() {  
    s1 := student{
        firstName: "Naveen",
        lastName:  "Ramanathan",
        grade:     "A",
        country:   "India",
    }
    s2 := student{
        firstName: "Samuel",
        lastName:  "Johnson",
        grade:     "B",
        country:   "USA",
    }
    s := []student{s1, s2}
    f := filter(s, func(s student) bool {
        if s.grade == "B" {
            return true
        }
        return false
    })
    fmt.Println(f)
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/YUL1CqSrvfc)

In the main function, we first create two students `s1` and `s2` and add them to slice `s`. Now let's say we want to find out all students who have grade `B`. We have established this in the above program by passing a function which checks whether the student has grade `B` and if so then returning true, as a parameter to the `filter` function in line no. 38. The above program will print,

```
[{Samuel Johnson B USA}]
```

Let's say we want to find all students from India. This can be done easily by changing the function parameter to the filter function.  
I have provided code that does this below,

```
c := filter(s, func(s student) bool {  
    if s.country == "India" {
        return true
    }
    return false
})
fmt.Println(c)  
```

Please add this to the main function and check the output.

Let's conclude this section by writing one more program. This program will perform the same operations on each element of a slice and return the result. For example, if we want to multiply all integers in a slice by 5 and return the output, it can be easily done using first class functions. These kinds of functions which operate on every element of a collection are called `map` functions. I have provided the program below. It is self-explanatory.

```
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
)

func iMap(s []int, f func(int) int) []int {  
    var r []int
    for _, v := range s {
        r = append(r, f(v))
    }
    return r
}
func main() {  
    a := []int{5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
    r := iMap(a, func(n int) int {
        return n * 5
    })
    fmt.Println(r)
}
```

[Run in playground](https://play.golang.org/p/cs37QwCQ_0H)

The above program will print,

```
[25 30 35 40 45]
```
